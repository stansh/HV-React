One of few establishments to serve a full, chef-driven menu paired with world-class music performances seven nights a week, the Dakota is more than a restaurant and more than a music club; it's where love of great food and great music come together as a seamless duet. In addition to being a nationally recognized Twin Cities live music institution for over 30 years, we offer a full service, critically acclaimed restaurant with special event options available for weddings of all sizes for lunch, dinner, and live entertainment."
